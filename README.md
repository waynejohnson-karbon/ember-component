# Demo Ember Components

This repo is a proof of concept for consuming into other Karbon FE applications.

## How to consume

Coming soon.

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Browse demo container app at [http://localhost:4400](http://localhost:4400).

4400 has been chosen as our app is probably running somewhere in the background, and 4300 is probably used as part of your own experiments. 4400 won't upset other stuff.

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `npm test-ui`

### Deploying

Coming soon.
